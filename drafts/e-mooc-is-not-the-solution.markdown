Looks like a dirty attempt to bring education for all.

Only 'learning' aspects of it
    * They say no prerequisites
        really?
        the guy who has no prerequisites suffer the most -- learning curve is steepest for him.
        solution: why not just TELL these are the prerequisites? Programming, matrices, etc?
        solution: wouldn't it help if you give some pointers for him to study first the basic bits and then come back to the course? 
        rant: maybe you people are just looking at number of people who join the course
    * Only course material: videos and slides
        Videos
            not an issue in understanding them for the first time.
            but how do i revise the things I learnt later?
        slides
            can't understand a bit by looking at the slides
            is just a mishmash of information written in short plus some scribblings which I cannot make sense of later
    * No 'cards' to revise it at a later point of time
    * No 'cheatsheet' to just look at the formulates
    * No 'short summary of chapter' at end of course


Some solutions:
    Simple self-assessment test, which will just make one understand the concepts thoroughly
        DO NOT show answers at the end of each question. Show at last, useful also to collect metrics against huge number of people
